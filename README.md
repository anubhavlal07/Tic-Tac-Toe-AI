# Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository is dedicated to the development of a tic-tac-toe game bot that utilizes the minimax algorithm to play against the user. The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in game theory and artificial intelligence to determine the best move for a player. By using this algorithm, the bot is able to evaluate all possible outcomes of a move and select the one that results in the best possible outcome for itself.

The tic-tac-toe game bot that is developed in this repository is designed to provide a challenging and engaging experience for the user. The bot's ability to evaluate all possible outcomes of a move allows it to make strategic decisions, making the game more difficult for the user to win. Additionally, the bot is able to adapt to the user's playing style, providing an experience that is tailored to the user's skill level.

The repository also includes the source code and documentation necessary for other developers to learn from and potentially improve upon the bot. The goal of this project is to create a high-quality tic-tac-toe game bot that can be used as a learning tool for developers interested in artificial intelligence and game theory. By open sourcing the code and documentation, other developers can learn from the bot's implementation and potentially develop new and improved versions of the bot.
